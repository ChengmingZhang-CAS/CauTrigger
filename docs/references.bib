	abstract = {Single-cell technologies enable the dynamic analyses of cell fate mapping. However, capturing the gene regulatory relationships and identifying the driver factors that control cell fate decisions are still challenging. We present {CEFCON}, a network-based framework that first uses a graph neural network with attention mechanism to infer a cell-lineage-specific gene regulatory network ({GRN}) from single-cell {RNA}-sequencing data, and then models cell fate dynamics through network control theory to identify driver regulators and the associated gene modules, revealing their critical biological processes related to cell states. Extensive benchmarking tests consistently demonstrated the superiority of {CEFCON} in {GRN} construction, driver regulator identification, and gene module identification over baseline methods. When applied to the mouse hematopoietic stem cell differentiation data, {CEFCON} successfully identified driver regulators for three developmental lineages, which offered useful insights into their differentiation from a network control perspective. Overall, {CEFCON} provides a valuable tool for studying the underlying mechanisms of cell fate decisions from single-cell {RNA}-seq data.},

Here we use gene-regulatory networks inferred from single-cell multi-omics data to perform in silico transcription factor perturbations, simulating the consequent changes in cell identity using only unperturbed wild-type data. We apply this machine-learning-based approach, {CellOracle}, to well-established paradigms—mouse and human haematopoiesis, and zebrafish embryogenesis—and we correctly model reported changes in phenotype that occur as a result of transcription factor perturbation. Through systematic in silico transcription factor perturbation in the developing zebrafish, we simulate and experimentally validate a previously unreported phenotype that results from the loss of noto, an established notochord regulator. Furthermore, we identify an axial mesoderm regulator, lhx1a. Together, these results show that {CellOracle} can be used to analyse the regulation of cell identity by transcription factors, and can provide mechanistic insights into development and differentiation.},

Overall, {GEARS} can predict phenotypically distinct effects of multigene perturbations and thus guide the design of perturbational experiments.},

	abstract = {Transcription factors ({TFs}) are major trans-acting factors in transcriptional regulation. Therefore, elucidating {TF}-target interactions is a key step toward understanding the regulatory circuitry underlying complex traits such as human diseases. We previously published a reference {TF}-target interaction database for humans-{TRRUST} (Transcriptional Regulatory Relationships Unraveled by Sentence-based Text mining)-which was constructed using sentence-based text mining, followed by manual curation. Here, we present {TRRUST} v2 (www.grnpedia.org/trrust) with a significant improvement from the previous version, including a significantly increased size of the database consisting of 8444 regulatory interactions for 800 {TFs} in humans. More importantly, {TRRUST} v2 also contains a database for {TF}-target interactions in mice, including 6552 {TF}-target interactions for 828 mouse {TFs}. {TRRUST} v2 is also substantially more comprehensive and less biased than other {TF}-target interaction databases. We also improved the web interface, which now enables prioritization of key {TFs} for a physiological condition depicted by a set of user-input transcriptional responsive genes. With the significant expansion in the database size and inclusion of the new web tool for {TF} prioritization, we believe that {TRRUST} v2 will be a versatile database for the study of the transcriptional regulation involved in human diseases.},

	abstract = {Understanding cell state transitions and purposefully controlling them is a longstanding challenge in biology. Here we present cell state transition assessment and regulation ({cSTAR}), an approach for mapping cell states, modelling transitions between them and predicting targeted interventions to convert cell fate decisions. {cSTAR} uses omics data as input, classifies cell states, and develops a workflow that transforms the input data into mechanistic models that identify a core signalling network, which controls cell fate transitions by influencing whole-cell networks. By integrating signalling and phenotypic data, {cSTAR} models how cells manoeuvre in Waddington’s landscape1 and make decisions about which cell fate to adopt. Notably, {cSTAR} devises interventions to control the movement of cells in Waddington’s landscape. Testing {cSTAR} in a cellular model of differentiation and proliferation shows a high correlation between quantitative predictions and experimental data. Applying {cSTAR} to different types of perturbation and omics datasets, including single-cell data, demonstrates its flexibility and scalability and provides new biological insights. The ability of {cSTAR} to identify targeted perturbations that interconvert cell fates will enable designer approaches for manipulating cellular development pathways and mechanistically underpinned therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in multiplexed single‐cell transcriptomics experiments facilitate the high‐throughput study of drug and genetic perturbations. However, an exhaustive exploration of the combinatorial perturbation space is experimentally unfeasible. Therefore, computational methods are needed to predict, interpret, and prioritize perturbations. Here, we present the compositional perturbation autoencoder ({CPA}), which combines the interpretability of linear models with the flexibility of deep‐learning approaches for single‐cell response modeling. {CPA} learns to in silico predict transcriptional perturbation response at the single‐cell level for unseen dosages, cell types, time points, and species. Using newly generated single‐cell drug combination data, we validate that {CPA} can predict unseen drug combinations while outperforming baseline models. Additionally, the architecture's modularity enables incorporating the chemical representation of the drugs, allowing the prediction of cellular response to completely unseen drugs. Furthermore, {CPA} is also applicable to genetic combinatorial screens. We demonstrate this by imputing in silico 5,329 missing combinations (97.6\% of all possibilities) in a single‐cell Perturb‐seq experiment with diverse genetic interactions. We envision {CPA} will facilitate efficient experimental design and hypothesis generation by enabling in silico response prediction at the single‐cell level and thus accelerate therapeutic applications using single‐cell technologies.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new {eXplanation} framework, called {OrphicX}, for generating causal explanations for any graph neural networks ({GNNs}) based on learned latent causal factors. Specifically, we construct a distinct generative model and design an objective function that encourages the generative model to produce causal, compact, and faithful explanations. This is achieved by isolating the causal factors in the latent space of graphs by maximizing the information flow measurements. We theoretically analyze the cause-effect relationships in the proposed causal graph, identify node attributes as confounders between graphs and {GNN} predictions, and circumvent such confounder effect by leveraging the backdoor adjustment formula. Our framework is compatible with any {GNNs}, and it does not require access to the process by which the target {GNN} produces its predictions. In addition, it does not rely on the linear-independence assumption of the explained features, nor require prior knowledge on the graph learning tasks. We show a proof-of-concept of {OrphicX} on canonical classification problems on graph data. In particular, we analyze the explanatory subgraphs obtained from explanations for molecular graphs (i.e., Mutag) and quantitatively evaluate the explanation performance with frequently occurring subgraph patterns. Empirically, we show that {OrphicX} can effectively identify the causal semantics for generating causal explanations, significantly outperforming its alternatives.},
